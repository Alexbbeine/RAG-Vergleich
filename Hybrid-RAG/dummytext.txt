The Moreno family gathered on the first Sunday of every month in the old yellow house at the edge of the town of Riverton. The house belonged to Sofia Moreno and her husband, Alejandro Moreno. They had been married for more than forty years and were the grandparents at the center of a large, multi-generational family network.

Sofia and Alejandro had three children: their eldest daughter Isabel, their middle son Rafael, and their youngest daughter Lucia. These three adult children represented the second generation of the Moreno family. Each of them lived in a different part of Riverton, with different occupations, financial situations, and daily routines, but all three maintained a strong emotional connection to the yellow house and to their parents.

Isabel, the oldest child of Sofia and Alejandro, lived in the northern district of Riverton. She worked as a project manager in a technology company. Isabel was married to Thomas Beck, an engineer who had relocated to Riverton from another region. Isabel and Thomas formed a nuclear family unit with two children: their elder son Noah and their younger daughter Emma. Noah was fourteen years old and the oldest grandchild in the Moreno family. Emma was twelve years old. Noah and Emma were siblings who attended the same secondary school, although they were in different grades. Noah was already thinking about university and possible careers in science or music, while Emma was still exploring different interests in the middle years of school.

Rafael, the second child of Sofia and Alejandro, lived in the southern part of the city. He worked as a nurse in the main city hospital and often had to work irregular shifts, including nights and weekends. Rafael was married to Lina, a freelance graphic designer who worked mostly from home for small local clients. Rafael and Lina formed eine second nuclear family within the Moreno clan. They had three children: their oldest son Mateo, their middle daughter Carla, and their youngest son Jonas. At the time of the monthly gatherings, Mateo was eleven years old, Carla was nine years old, and Jonas was six years old. These three siblings shared a small bedroom in the apartment of Rafael and Lina. Their everyday life was shaped by limited space, a modest budget, and the constant presence of hospital schedules and design deadlines.

Lucia, the youngest child of Sofia and Alejandro, differed from her siblings in several respects. She was not married and lived as a single mother in a small apartment near the river that flowed through Riverton. Lucia had twins: a son named Leo and a daughter named Mila. Leo and Mila were seven years old. They were siblings and also the only pair of twins among the grandchildren. The twins did not have regular contact with their father, who lived in another country and communicated only occasionally. As a result, the emotional bond between Lucia, her children, and the grandparents was especially strong. The yellow house functioned for them as a stable point in a life with more uncertainties than in the households of Isabel or Rafael.

The extended family of the Morenos included other relatives who were closely connected to the yellow house. Sofia’s older sister, Elena, lived in a small annex behind the main building. The family usually called her Aunt Elena. She was a widow, because her husband, Miguel, had died many years earlier. Elena had no children of her own, but she played an important role in the lives of the nieces, nephews, and grandchildren. She often acted as an additional caregiver, confidante, and observer. Through her, the Moreno family connected to an older generation of stories, habits, and traditions.

On a typical first Sunday of the month, the arrival of the different family units followed a pattern. Isabel and Thomas usually arrived first with Noah and Emma, driving from the northern district in a dark blue car. They formed the first visible layer of the gathering: the oldest daughter, her husband, and the two oldest grandchildren. Shortly afterward, Rafael and Lina appeared with Mateo, Carla, and Jonas, often carrying bags filled with side dishes and spare clothes for the children. Lucia tended to arrive last with Leo and Mila, because her route by public transport was more complicated and the twins needed extra time in the morning. Aunt Elena, by contrast, was always already present, since she lived directly on the property. Sofia and Alejandro played the role of hosts and central reference points, welcoming each arriving group.

Once everyone had arrived, the yellow house transformed into a dense network of movements, conversations, and relationships. The grandparents, their three adult children, the spouses, the seven grandchildren, and Aunt Elena distributed themselves across the kitchen, the living room, the hallway, and the garden. Alejandro usually took responsibility for preparing food in the garden, especially when grilling was possible. Sofia organized the dishes in the kitchen, coordinated tasks between the adults, and monitored the overall situation. Isabel often discussed work and long-term plans with her siblings. Rafael kept an eye on the health and safety of the children, watching for minor injuries and conflicts. Lucia moved frequently between the adult discussions and the activities of the twins, bridging different parts of the family.

The network of relationships among the grandchildren contained many patterns. Noah, as the oldest grandchild, frequently took on responsibility for younger cousins. He helped Leo and Mila with games in the garden and guided Jonas away from dangerous places near the fence. Emma and Mateo were close in age and shared several interests, including drawing and reading. They sometimes formed a sub-group within the larger cluster of children. Carla, as a nine-year-old, often oriented herself toward Emma and followed her around the house. Jonas, as the youngest boy, was attracted to energetic activities and often joined Leo in climbing, running, or exploring. Mila moved between the cousins and the adults. She liked to stay near Lucia and Sofia and listened attentively when the adults told stories about the past.

Economic differences also influenced the dynamics of the Moreno family. Isabel and Thomas, with their combined income from stable jobs in technology and engineering, belonged to a relatively secure middle-class household. They could afford regular vacations and extracurricular activities for Noah und Emma. Rafael and Lina, in contrast, had a more limited and fluctuating budget because Rafael’s shift work and Lina’s freelance projects created financial uncertainty. Lucia, as a single mother, experienced the largest economic pressure of the three siblings. She worked part time in a small office and occasionally took on additional temporary jobs. These differences sometimes created tension, for example when holiday plans or school activities required payments. Sofia and Alejandro were aware of these imbalances and tried to offer support without making the differences more visible than necessary.

The Sunday gatherings served several functions at the same time. On one level, they provided shared meals and social contact. On another level, they functioned as an information exchange. In the kitchen, Isabel summarized developments in her company and described organizational changes. Rafael reported on the situation in the hospital, mentioning staff shortages and new procedures. Lucia talked about the daily reality of raising twins alone and about teachers and classmates at the local primary school. Lina used the opportunity to describe design projects for small businesses in Riverton. Thomas contributed technical news related to his engineering work, explaining long-term infrastructure plans in the city. Through these conversations, the family constructed a shared understanding of the environment in which they all lived, even though their daily experiences differed.

The children also exchanged information, although in a simpler form. Noah described his music group at school and his attempts to compose songs. Emma showed Carla and Mila small drawings she had made during the week. Mateo reported on football matches and training sessions. Carla talked about books from the school library. Leo and Jonas discussed a video game they both liked, even though they had limited access to electronic devices at home. Each of these interactions strengthened specific links: cousin-to-cousin, sibling-to-sibling, and child-to-adult.

The whole structure of the Moreno family could be imagined as a layered graph. At the center stood Sofia and Alejandro as the founding couple. From them radiated three main branches representing Isabel, Rafael, and Lucia. Each branch contained marital or partnership edges, parental edges to the third generation, and connections to places such as the northern district, the southern district, and the river area of Riverton. Additional edges connected to Aunt Elena in the annex, to workplaces such as the technology company, the hospital, and the design studio, and to institutions like schools and sports clubs attended by the grandchildren.

At the end of each Sunday, the density of this temporary graph decreased as the family members departed in stages. Rafael and Lina usually left first with Mateo, Carla, and Jonas, because Jonas needed an early bedtime before school. Isabel and Thomas followed with Noah and Emma, driving back to the northern district. Lucia left last with Leo and Mila, walking with them to the nearest bus stop. The twins often held hands as they went down the hill. After the departures, Sofia and Alejandro remained in the yellow house with Aunt Elena. They cleared the dishes, reviewed the events of the day, and reflected on the visible and invisible ties that bound their many-headed family together. In these quiet evening hours, the old house contained fewer people but still held the accumulated traces of conversations, decisions, and memories that defined the Moreno family as a connected whole.
